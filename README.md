Distributed Remote Futures
==========================

Futures are the abstraction of an asnychronous execution of code, whose result will be eventually available. 
The main purpose of this project is to extend the execution context of futures to gain advantage from the computational power of remote nodes. Instead of using the local capabiliies of a maschinem the execution of futures is extend3ed towards a distributed system while still fulfillung a concise, but not intrusive syntax and programming model. Thus, extending this context of execution yields substantial gain in execution by extending to nodes of a distributed system, without introducing more complexity from a developer's perspective.
