### Getting started:

on SBT console:

      > projects

      [info] 	   benchmark
      [info] 	   macros
      [info] 	*  root

      >  project benchmark

      > run


Sample output would be:

    Execution Time for 10 iterations in SECONDS

    Min Execution Time,   0.0
    Max Execution Time,   1.794740867
    Mean Execution Time,  1.1813842525000002
    Variance Execution Time, 0.18427792796747244
    Standard derivation Execution Time, 0.429276051006194

    Done! Benchmarking execution time Futures Par Arr took: 11 SECONDS
    Throughput is: 953250 OPS/SECONDS

Throughput is estimated by dividing the number of operations through execution time.

All results are placed into the folder "Results" as Excel sheets for further analysis.
