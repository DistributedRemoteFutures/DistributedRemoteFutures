Code Of Conduct
============

Original at:
http://docs.scala-lang.org/conduct.html

 This Code of Conduct covers our behaviour as members of the Scala Community,
 in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, hackathon, public meeting or private correspondence.
 Scala moderators are appointed by EPFL / Typesafe to maintain the health of the community and will arbitrate
 in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.

The code of conduct consists of a few simple rules:

(1) Be Respectful
-----------------

The Scala community is made up of a diverse set of individuals and backgrounds.
Everyone can make a contribution to Scala. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior.
Also, many users coming to Scala might have different background than others.
Not knowing a particular domain is not just cause for rude behavior.
On the flip side, if someone is suggesting concepts that go beyond your basic understanding,
patiently asking for more information is the right way to go.
In all interactions, treat each other with respect.


(2) Be Courteous
----------------

Whether posting to a mailing list, or submitting a bug report we value your contribution to Scala.
When working with another’s work, be courteous and professional.
It’s not courteous to demand responses, insult pull requests or post condescending bug reports.
In that same vein, avoid posting messages with little to no content on the mailing list.
We have a lot of people in the community, let’s keep our signal to noise ratio high,
and set emotions aside before coming to the table.

(3) Be Excellent
-----------------

Strive to improve in all things. Strive to better Scala, and improve understanding.
Improve your own teaching styles. Change the way we think about code design.
Scala is a gateway into a new world of software design, and we’re constantly learning new things
and opening new avenues. Leave your mind open to try new things, and strive to
improve what we already know.

(4) Be Thorough
----------------

No matter what it is, responding to a question, fixing a bug, writing a proposal,
make sure the contribution is thorough. Don’t leave things half written or half done.
While the evolution of Scala is a continual process, incomplete work is often of negative benefit.
At the same time, contributors will come and go, as with any open source community.
If you need to drop something, take measures to ensure someone else is willing to pick it up,
or notify the other maintainers.


The Mailing Lists
-----------------

The Scala mailing lists are split into several sub-lists:

* __scala-user__ This is a mailing list for beginners/users of scala. No question is a dumb question on Scala user. No a priori knowledge of math, functional programing, java, or other topics should be assumed on this list. Any question can and should receive a courteous and insightful answer.
* __scala-debate__  This is the ‘anthing goes’ list. You can bring up any issue, any topic, even heated ones. While professional courtesy and respect must be maintained, this is where discussion on controversial topics can occur, or “what-if” type questions.
* __scala-internals__ This is the list relating to compiler/library development. If you’re into the actually day-to-day nuts and bolts of jenkins, pull requests and compiler bugs, this is the place to hang out. New implementations are discussed here, after being proposed to the general public.
* __scala-language__ This list is for questions relating to the language itself and its specification. This includes deep topics like “Why do implicits work this way” or “What does Foo extends Any mean?”
* __scala-sips__ This list is for collaboration and feedback regarding actively developed new features for Scala. A SIP includes both the proposal process, as well as the implemenetation and integration into scala core. If you want to see what’s coming down the pipe and you’d like to be involved, this is the mailing list for you.
* __scala-tools__ This list is specifically for tooling around Scala, such as emacs, maven, ant and gedit. If you have a question, this may be the right list for you.
* __scala-announce__ This list is for announcements only. All posts are moderated.
